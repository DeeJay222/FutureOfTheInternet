        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The internet has changed how we live, work, and connect. It has evolved from basic web pages to complex platforms. The internet of the future will be shaped by new technologies and global challenges. Understanding these changes is crucial for staying relevant. This page discusses some key aspects shaping the future. Topics include AI, speed, decentralization, privacy, and accessibility. These areas will have the biggest impact on how we use the internet.</p>

    <section id="ai">
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence & IoT</h2>
        <p>AI and IoT are merging to create smarter environments. These technologies make everyday tasks more efficient. Smart homes and cities are becoming more common. Devices that communicate with each other can make decisions without human input. This transformation is changing how we work and live. Security and data privacy will be challenges as AI and IoT expand. More regulations will be needed to protect users.

    </section>
    <section id="speed">
        <h2>Internet Speeds</h2>
        <p>Internet speed is crucial for modern applications. 5G technology is rolling out worldwide. It offers faster speeds and lower latency. Researchers are already working on 6G, which could transform connectivity again. Faster speeds will support real-time applications like holographic communication. The debate between wireless and fiber speeds is ongoing. Both have unique strengths and weaknesses.

    </section>
    <section id="decentralization">
        <h2>Internet Decentralization</h2>
        <p>The internet is often controlled by a few major companies. Decentralization aims to change that. Blockchain technology is key in this shift. Users want more control over their data and online identity. Decentralized systems can reduce monopolies and increase privacy. They can also make networks more resilient. This model still faces challenges like standardization and user adoption. (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/06/decentralized-not-fragmented-new-way-think-about-operations/">Source</a>)</p>
    </section>
    <section id="privacy">
        <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
        <p>Privacy remains a top concern for internet users. Data breaches have become more common. Future networks will need stronger encryption and better user controls. Some experts predict a shift toward user-owned data. New laws may enforce stricter data protection standards. Companies will have to be more transparent. Users must be aware of their rights and how data is collected. (<a href="https://www.numsp.com/blog/the-future-of-online-privacy">Source</a>)</p>
    </section>
    <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Global Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Access to the internet remains uneven worldwide. Some areas still lack basic connectivity. International laws aim to make the internet more accessible. Efforts focus on affordability and inclusion. Digital accessibility also considers users with disabilities. Standards like WCAG are being updated to reflect new tech. Governments and companies must work together to close the digital gap. (<a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/navigating-international-accessibility-laws/">Source</a>)</p>
